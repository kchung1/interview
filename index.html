			<h3>Why do you want to become a designer?</h3>

			<p>I want to become a designer because I have a passion for image making. I want to use the techniques and skills I have acquired to assist society with understanding important messages visually. I also want to look at ways to use design to help change issues within our world. For example, I want to speak to the environmental problems. Design for me is very important, and I want every opportunity to be a part of it.</p>

			<h3>What makes you nervous about becoming a designer?</h3>

			<p>Some concerns I have about becoming a designer is that I need to solve issues about my creative style and my strong points with graphic design. The more education I am exposed to, the more I feel like I will find something I am very passionate about.</p>

			<h3>What excites you about design?</h3>

			<p>Like I said, I am very passionate about image making. What excites me, is the fact that I could have a career doing something I love. I also enjoy pushing the possibilities and thinking outside the box. Technology and globalization are making it easier and easier to portray design in many locations.</p>

			<h3>What are your strengths?</h3>

			<p>Some of my strengths in design is my attention to detail. I am good at dissecting an image or design and finding where it may be successful or where it may be weak. I do this by using basic principles and elements of design. Photography is also another strength I would have, as I have some experience in the ‘real’ world.</p>

			<h3>What are some areas of opportunity to work on?</h3>

			<p>I want to develop my strengths as an illustrator. I have recently got into ink drawing and I thoroughly enjoy it.  I also want to develop my strengths digitally in Adobe programs like in design and illustrator. Developing my skills of creating graphics and vectors on a higher and more professional level. I also would like to learn more about web design. I feel like it is very useful and applicable to many different realms in the field.</p>

			<h3>What aspects of graphic design do you gravitate towards?</h3>

			<h3>What are the roles and responsibilities of a graphic designer in society?</h3>

			<p>In society, design is very important. Whether it’s to push or pull a door, or to help navigate someone through a building with signs. Design is also important for companies and platforms that are looking to send a message. Using a symbol that can be universally stable and relative is also important. Graphic design can sometimes be the reason we pick one box of cookies over the other.</p>

			<h3>When/ where/ why are you at your most creative/productive?</h3>

			<p>I am a person who gets very easily distracted. I am at my most creative when I am inspired. Whether it is something I see, or a feeling I acquire. I have days where I can be blocked from creativity which can be very detrimental. I am productive in a common area, a place where people are working or talking amongst each other, and I usually have headphones in either playing something toned down or simply just the sound of rain/thunder. I need to be comfortable, maybe I have a tea beside me. When I feel good about what I am doing I can get a lot more done, and done well.</p>

			<h3>What are your comfort levels with giving and receiving feedback? How might you improve your skills here? What strategies have worked for you?</h3>

			<p>I would say I am comfortable getting critiqued, mostly because I have had much experience in university with this. The critique at times felt like a personal attack at first. I’ve learned that I have become better at understanding why people are saying what they say and how it can help shape me as a designer. Like I mentioned earlier I enjoy dissecting work and understanding why I think it is good or not successful. Strategies that work for me include: not taking things personally, and using the principles and elements of deign to dissect work.</p>

			<h3>What is a website?</h3>

			<p>A website is a visually stimulating platform, that is composed of data.  In some cases, the data works together so that the viewer can interact with it. Websites have evolved to become places where people can store valuable information. This information may also be accessed at any given point, all around the world.</p>
